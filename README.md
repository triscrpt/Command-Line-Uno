# Command Line Uno

This is my first project since college that ive decided to make.

The idea of making uno was inspired by my gf who loves the game, i had been thinking about something i wanted to make to be able to display my abilites as a programmer outside of college work. I would love for you to take a look at my work and get in touch with me on any of my socials or email and give me critique and improvements if you see things that could be better, im always happy to learn and improve on myself as a programmer.
